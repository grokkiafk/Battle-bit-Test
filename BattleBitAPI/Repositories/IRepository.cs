 * This repository interface serves as an abstraction of repository objects in some storage system.
 * This way, the application can use a set of model instances without having to be aware of the storage implementation.
 * This allows for a nice separation of concerns and you can change storage systems
 * easily without having to change the main application logic, by just changing IRepository implementations.
